## üßæ Overview

This document outlines how the **Lacque&latte website** and **booking/admin system** comply with Canada's **Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)**.  
It applies to all digital services provided under **Lacque&latte Nail Studio**, developed and maintained by **Arvado IT Solutions**.

---

## 1. üìú Privacy Policy Requirements

The public website must include a **Privacy Policy** accessible from the footer.  
The policy should explain:

- **What data is collected:**  
  Name, phone number, email, appointment details, messages, and communication preferences.  

- **How data is used:**  
  To process bookings, send reminders, and manage client relations.  

- **How data is stored:**  
  Securely in encrypted MongoDB Atlas databases (encryption at rest and in transit).  

- **Who has access:**  
  Authorized salon administrators and Arvado technical staff for maintenance only.  

- **Third-party service providers:**  
  - Vercel (hosting)  
  - MongoDB Atlas (database)  
  - SendGrid (email delivery)  
  - Twilio (SMS notifications)  

- **Data retention:**  
  Client data is kept only as long as required for operational purposes (maximum 2 years after last interaction).  

- **Client rights:**  
  Clients can request to access, correct, or delete their personal data by contacting  
  `privacy@lacqueandlatte.ca`.

- **Consent:**  
  Clients must check a consent box on the booking form before submitting personal data.

|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Database** | Encryption at rest & transit | MongoDB Atlas (TLS + AES-256) |
| **Hosting** | Secure HTTPS | Vercel-managed SSL certificates |

## 3. üß† User Consent & Control

PIPEDA requires **meaningful consent**. The website and booking system must:

- Include an **explicit consent checkbox** before form submission.  
  _Example:_  
  > "I consent to the collection and use of my personal information for appointment scheduling and communications, in accordance with the Privacy Policy."

- Store the **timestamp of consent** in MongoDB (e.g., `consentAccepted: true`, `consentDate: "2025-10-16"`).  
- Provide a **clear opt-out** option for SMS and email reminders.  
- Provide an **email contact** for data removal or updates.  

---

## 4. üíå Email & SMS (CASL Alignment)

Because Lacque&latte sends appointment reminders and possibly promotions, compliance with **Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL)** is required alongside PIPEDA.

| Message Type | Consent Required | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|-------|
| **Transactional (e.g., appointment reminders)** | Implied consent | Allowed after a booking |
| **Promotional (e.g., marketing offers)** | Express consent | Checkbox required |
| **Opt-out** | Mandatory | "Unsubscribe" link or "Reply STOP" message |

All SendGrid email templates and Twilio SMS messages must include a **clear unsubscribe method**.

## 5. üß∞ Data Management & Retention

- **Retention period:** 2 years after last appointment.  
- **Deletion requests:** Users can email `privacy@lacqueandlatte.ca` to have their record removed.  
- **Data export:** Provide a simple JSON/CSV export of user data on request.  
- **Audit log:** Record admin access and updates (recommended).  

---

## 6. üßë‚Äçüíº Administrative Measures

- **Privacy Officer:**  
  Arvado IT Solutions ‚Äì Data Protection Contact  
  Email: `privacy@arvado.ca`  

- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Ensure staff compliance with privacy policies.  
  - Respond to client privacy requests.  
  - Maintain documentation of third-party service agreements.  

- **Third-party contracts:**
