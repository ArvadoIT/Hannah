## Critical Path Forward

### Immediate Actions Required

#### 1. Fix Admin Dashboard (PRIORITY 1)
```bash
# Verify admin page exists
ls -la src/app/admin/

# Check admin page code
cat src/app/admin/page.tsx

# Verify routing configuration
```

**Steps:**
1. Confirm admin page component exists and exports correctly
2. Verify CSS class names match test selectors
3. Check authentication/middleware isn't blocking test access
4. Ensure dev server runs before tests execute

#### 2. Configure Test Setup (PRIORITY 2)
```javascript
// playwright.config.ts
{
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run dev',
    port: 3000,
    timeout: 120 * 1000,
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
}
```

**Verify:**
- Base URL is correct (likely http://localhost:3000)
- Web server starts before tests run
- Proper timeout configured

#### 3. Fix Firefox Mobile Tests (PRIORITY 3)
Update mobile tests to use Firefox-compatible configuration:
```javascript
// Remove isMobile flag for Firefox
// Use viewport settings instead
{
  viewport: { width: 375, height: 667 },
  hasTouch: true,
}
```

#### 4. Performance Optimizations (PRIORITY 4)
- Optimize hero image loading
- Implement lazy loading strategies
- Add proper image preloading
- Investigate WebKit frame rate issues

## Success Metrics

### Current vs Target

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Test Pass Rate | 72% | 95%+ | 🔴 Below Target |
| Admin Tests | 0% | 100% | 🔴 Critical |
| Performance Tests | ~75% | 95%+ | 🟡 Needs Work |
| Cross-Browser | Mixed | Consistent | 🟡 Needs Work |
| Mobile Tests | ~70% | 95%+ | 🟡 Needs Work |

---

## Conclusion

The Next.js app has a **solid foundation** with 366 passing tests covering core functionality like booking flows, calendar, portfolio, and navigation. However, the **admin dashboard is completely non-functional** in the test environment, representing a critical blocker.

**Immediate Focus:** Fix admin dashboard rendering and ensure all admin-related tests pass.

**Next Steps:** Once admin issues are resolved, address performance optimizations and browser compatibility issues.
