npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run performance tests only
npm run test:performance

# Run console monitoring tests only
npm run test:console

# View test reports
npm run test:report
```

## Test Statistics

- **Test Suites**: 3
- **Individual Tests**: 30+
- **Pages Covered**: 6 (Home, Services, Portfolio, Calendar, Admin, 404)
- **Browsers**: 4 (Chromium Desktop, Chromium Mobile, Firefox, WebKit)
- **Metrics Tracked**: 15+ performance metrics per page

## Performance Thresholds

| Metric | Target | Priority |
|--------|--------|----------|
| DOM Content Loaded | < 2s | 🔴 High |
| Load Complete | < 3s | 🔴 High |
| LCP | < 2.5s | 🔴 High |
| FID | < 100ms | 🟡 Medium |
| CLS | < 0.1 | 🔴 High |
| Total Page Size | < 3MB | 🟡 Medium |
| Memory Usage | < 50MB | 🟢 Low |

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Performance Monitoring
Every test captures detailed performance metrics:
- Navigation timing
- Core Web Vitals
- Resource sizes and counts
- Memory usage
- Network requests

### 2. Intelligent Console Tracking
All console messages are captured with:
- Type classification (error, warning, log, info)
- Timestamps
- Source location
- Automatic filtering of benign dev messages

### 3. Smooth UX Validation
Tests ensure excellent user experience:
- No layout shifts during load or interaction
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Instant interactivity
- Graceful error handling
- Mobile-optimized interactions

### 4. Detailed Test Reports
Generated reports include:
- ✅ Pass/fail status with detailed assertions
- 📊 Performance metrics charts
- 📸 Screenshots on failure
- 🎥 Video recordings on failure
- 📝 Console logs
- 🌐 Network activity logs

## NPM Scripts Added

```json
{
  "test:e2e": "Run all E2E tests",
  "test:e2e:ui": "Run tests with interactive UI",
  "test:e2e:headed": "Run tests with visible browser",
  "test:e2e:debug": "Debug tests step-by-step",
  "test:performance": "Run only performance tests",
  "test:console": "Run only console monitoring tests",
  "test:report": "View last test report",
  "test:all": "Run ALL tests (type-check + lint + unit + E2E)"
}
```

## Migration Details

### What Changed
- ✅ All tests now focus on Next.js app (port 3000)
- ✅ Static site tests deprecated (port 8000)
- ✅ Enhanced monitoring capabilities
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ CI/CD ready configuration

### Old Testing (Static Site)
```
