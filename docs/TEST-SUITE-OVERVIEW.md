## 🔧 Customizing Tests

### Adjust Performance Thresholds

```typescript
await expectGoodPerformance(metrics, {
  domContentLoaded: 3000,  // Increase to 3s
  loadComplete: 5000,      // Increase to 5s
  maxImageSize: 2 * 1024 * 1024, // 2MB
});
```

### Add Allowed Console Patterns

```typescript
await expectNoConsoleErrors(consoleMessages, [
  /favicon\.ico/,
  /your-custom-pattern/,
]);
```

### Test Specific Pages

```typescript
test('Your custom test', async ({ page, capturePerformance }) => {
  await page.goto('/your-page');
  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
  
  const metrics = await capturePerformance();
  await expectGoodPerformance(metrics);
});
```
